# Elemental

Elemental is a modern library for building reactive Web Components. It simplifies component
creation with fine-grained reactivity, declarative APIs, and server-side rendering (SSR) support,
while staying lightweight and close to the native platform.

## Why?

Writing native Web Components can be verbose and complex. Elementary simplifies this with reactive
signals, strongly-typed and declarative JSX, and built-in server-side rendering â€” all without
sacrificing performance or flexibility.

## Features

- **Reactive Signals:** Manage state efficiently with fine-grained updates.
- **Declarative JSX:** Write clean, expressive components with JSX.
- **Web Standards:** Fully compatible with the Web Components API.
- **Server-Side Rendering:** Render lightweight, SEO-friendly HTML.
- **Composable API:** Share state and logic across components with context.
